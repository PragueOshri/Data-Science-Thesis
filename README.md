# Data-Science-Thesis
This Thesis explores the effect of the practical impact of war events and mental state on attention performance

dataset file<br/>
The dataset file initializes the data-frames we use in the rest of the analysis.<br/>
It takes the data from: 

** An online questionnaire includes:
1. Demographics questionnaire
2. War experiences questionnaire
3. DASS (Depression, Anxiety, and Stress Scales) questionnaire
4. PCL - PTSD symptoms questionnaire
5. Brief COPE questionnaire (focus on three coping methods, problem-focuser, emotional-focuser, and avoidance)
6. ASRS (ADHD self-report scale) questionnaire
<br/>
** Data from a computerized attention task (ANT - attention network task) included different measures such as reaction time and accuracy.
   Moreover, it computed measures of attention like phasic alertness and executive control.<br/>
<br/>
Univariate file<br/>
The Univariate file computed the distributions of the different features and visualized them.<br/>
<br/>
Bivariate file<br/>
The Bivariate file computed the interactions between pairs of features.<br/>
<br/>
Multivariate file<br/>
The Multivariate file includes two steps of analysis:
1. Factor analysis to reduce the dimension of the features we are looking at
2. Hierarchical regression analysis to see the influence of each feature on the attention measures
   (This section has been computed using JASP and SPSS, so it is not included in the code).
